## About
Lightweight, mobile-friendly portfolio site based on [this template](https://github.com/mmeurer00/react-navbar-tailwindcss) from Maxine Meurer. 

I've made modifications to the navbar and added a projects page.

## Files to Edit / Resume Tips
- Edit the file in `public/resume.pdf` to be your own resume
    - If you need a resume format, see: https://www.overleaf.com/read/jxnmjmzktxrh (make your own copy on Overleaf)
- Edit `src/Example/index.js` to cover your own personal details
- Edit `src/Example/projects.js` to match your own personal projects
- Edit `src/Navigation/Navbar.js` to have your social media links etc.
- You may want to make further edits to the styling or add pages, use your imagination! In general, see:
